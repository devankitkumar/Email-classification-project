# This is an e-mail classification project in which our model will predict whether the entered e-mail message is spam or not. It is a classification project. But this time our data is not in a tabular form, instead it is in a text form. So we have an un-ordered data (text data) and our algorithm only takes numerical data. So, in this project, I have used count_vectorizer to convert text data into numerical data. And then I also have used BernoulliNB algorithm to predict whether the email is ham or spam.
